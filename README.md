###HipLink - tool for HipChat IM Service

I built HipLink as my 1st project in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive Program.  In class, we were posting links to resources & tutorials in HipChat (IM service) but it was difficult to sort through the history logs later on to find them. I created HipLink as my 1st project to solve this problem and have it as a tool throughout the rest of our program.  

Hiplink pulls in links from Hipchat messages and saves them to autogenerated folders created by the '/folderName' posted before the link url in the Hipchat message.

Example post:

/events www.sfoutsidelands.com #san_francisco #concerts

* In this example, Hiplink generates a Folder called 'events' and saves the link to Outside Lands inside it. If the user posts hashtags after the url, they can filter their links in Hiplink to find the ones with the hashtag of 'san_francisco' or 'concerts'.
